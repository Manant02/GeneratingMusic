# GeneratingMusic
Generative modelling deals with analysis of complex data distributions of content of various kind. This includes images, texts and sounds. By analysing a dataset of such content with an appropriate artificial neural network model we can learn how the data is built up and synthesise new data that is indistinguishable from the original dataset. In recent years great resources have gone into research and development of such models, especially for image generation. My goal was to develop a model that is capable of generating new original music. I have documented the development and training of a stacked variational autoencoder that can sucessfully generate new 16-measure songs. The songs generated showed clear musical elements such as rhythm, melody and song structure.
